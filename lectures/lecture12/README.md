        1. write the tests
        2. check that they fail
        3. make code that passes those tests
        4. refactor to make it look like real code
        5. goto 1

- you can use whatever test library you like most
- apply tdd while creating them and document it in the code (not much is needed, just to check that
  you have really followed some sort of TDD).
