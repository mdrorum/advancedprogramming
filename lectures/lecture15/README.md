# Lecture 15: Other languages

- Other languages (and what they are good for)
    - Python, Ruby and Lua
        - dynamic languages
        - used for non-scripting tasks: webapps, desktop apps, prototyping...
        - bad performance (often acceptable for your purposes), high productivity
    - Javascript
        - Web programming
        - Not only web programming (node.js)
        - The assembler of the web
    - Scala/Scheme/Clojure/Haskell...
        - Functional programming from different perspectives
        - Reasonable performance
        - Positive influence in imperative languages
    - Prolog and logic languages
        - NLP
        - Knowledge represetation
        - Not widely used in production environments
    - Java and C#
        - When you don't need 
        - When you can cope with GC
        - When your team can't manage the complexity of other languages

# Exercises

- write a script in Python or Ruby (preferably the one you know less) that:
    - asks for the number of players
    - asks for the size of the field
    - runs a simulation with those parameters
    - Use Qt or whatever other GUI framework you prefer
