# Lecture 1 - assembling a toolset

- Compiling with `gcc`
    - explain gcc
    - compile gcc & g++
    - talk about compilers
    - build with optimizations
    - build with debugging symbols (check size)

- Includes and libraries
    - compile without stdc++
    - compile with it
    - compile without m
    - compile with it
    - library path
    - include path
- Makefiles

    - write makefile: http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html
    - write cmake: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake_tutorial.html

- CMake
- `pkg-config`
    - explain it
    - show examples in console
    - explain with sdl
    - explain backticks
- VCS. Git

    - explain git: http://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial
    - create a github account
    - upload code
    - create a branch
    - check it out
    - merge branches
    - go up and down in history
    - make them contribute: clone my repo and suggest a change: http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html
- Advanced code editing
    - indent it (use several indentations!)
- Automatic formatting
    - vim & emacs
    - ctags & etags
- Code documentation
    - doxygen: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html
    - doxygen -g
    - edit doxygen file
    - man and APIs on the Internet


# Exercise

- upload a project to github
- must include a makefile
- must include a cmake file
- must be automatically indented
- must be well documented
- cmake + make must build everything including documentation
- they must find out how to tell cmake create doxygen documentation
- make all projects be available on github
